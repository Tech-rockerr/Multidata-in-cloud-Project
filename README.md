# Multidata-in-cloud(project)

-->The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly in many organizations. Cloud computing provides many benefits in terms of low cost and accessibility of data.


-->Ensuring the security of cloud computing is a major factor in the cloud computing environment, as users often store sensitive information with cloud storage providers but these    providers may be untrusted

# EXISTING SYSTEM

->The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly in many organizations. Cloud providers should address privacy and security issues as a matter of high and urgent priority. 

->Distributing data over different cloud storage providers. (CSPs) automatically provides users with a certain degree of information leakage control, for no single point of attack can leak all the information

# Problem description in existing system:

•	The loss of service availability has caused many problems for a large number of customers recently.

•	Single cloud providers are predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure.

•	The data stored in the cloud may suffer from damage during transition operations from or to the cloud storage provider.



# PROPOSED SYSTEM
->In multiple cloud system we improve security while transfer the data from one end to another. Attackers may hack our message during communication between two users. To avoid this theft we perform encryption. By using this technique we convert our original message into another format. 

->In receiver end, we perform decryption to get the original data. Moving from single clouds or inner-clouds to multicourse is reasonable and important for many reasons. Services of single clouds are still subject to outage. In addition, showed that over 80% of company management fear security threats and loss of control of data and systems. 


# Advantages 

•	Small and medium companies use cloud computing services for various reasons, including because these services provide fast access to their applications and reduce their infrastructure costs.

•	Cloud computing provides many benefits in terms of low cost and accessibility of data.

•	The secret sharing algorithm to reduce the risk of data intrusion and the loss of service availability in the cloud and ensure data integrity.

•	Solution can avoid data corruption caused by some components in the cloud.
